# Handling Multiple Intents in Watson Assistant

By default, Watson Assistant handles one intent at a time. For example, if we have an intent #Transactions that handles transactions queries and a user asks "I want to check my Transactions",
then assistant jumps to the node that responds to this condition. What about multiple intents in the same query? It gets more complicated when a user asks multiple questions at the same time. Let's say a user asks "I want to check my Transactions and my current balance?", in this example we have 
two different intents, one reponsible for transactions and the other for checking the balance. We will see how we can tweak the assistant to give him the ability to handle multiple intents and thus make it smarter.

# How Intents works?
Intents in Watson assistant are triggered using a conficence score. Whenever a user asks a question, it is sent to every intent model that you have created, and each intent model returns a confidence score. The assistant statifsies the condition using the intent that has the highest confidence score.
Let's say we have 3 intent models : #Transactions, #Balance and #Greetings. If a user asks a questions regarding his balance then highest confidence score will be the #Balance intent, and thus the assistant triggers the node that uses the #Balance intent.
